Employment Data App

This is an Employment Data App. This project is a work in progress and it was created during the Hackathon. 
What this project is suppose to do is help people find companies that they want to work for based on the companies 
reputation. This will be a possible mobile app. When the person opens up the app, they will see a bar chart that shows
the companies and then people can click on the company that they like and see the logistics of that company and the 
reviews of that company. It will also link them to a map that will show them the location of that comapny as well as
details on who to contact for applying a possible job position. People will also get the chance to refine their
searches by type of field, proximity of the person, etc...This app benefits people who are looking for 
jobs but want to find a company that does well, can last long, and is convienent for them.
